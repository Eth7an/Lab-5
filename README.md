# Lab-5
Computer Architecture Lab Assignment

For this lab, I created a RAM module (data memory) as part of a CPU to store 256x32 bits.

RAM is an essential part of the CPU. A cpu doesnâ€™t operate on data which is in storage, instead it operates on data stored in much faster, although smaller, RAM modules. Each time a computer has an operation to perform, the data required for the operation is moved from storage to RAM.
